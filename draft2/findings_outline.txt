hedonic regression
    hedonic characteristics do have big, significant impact on sale price of painting
    date of creation not significant
    high rsq for impress / contemp, but low rsq for assorted art
    very significant f stat
    highly significant intercept for impress
    presence of signature - very significant
    sig - more important for nyc. med - more important for london
    regress on only artist + time -> reduction in rsq

replication: beggs & graddy (2009)
    able to replicate: significant anchoring effects
    anchoring coefs not as large overall
    past residuals more influential than anchoring
    able to replicate: small time coefs
    able to replicate: high rsq
    on your data: 
        low rsq
        f stat high
        very significant and strong anchoring effects
        past residual not as influential
        weak time effects

anchoring cross-effects (general)
    Q1
        anchoring effects:
            lose sig for contemp
                b/c: diversity of contemp art -> no more sig, sig past residual
            retain sig for impress 
                (small coef for impress)
                b/c: impress prices rise over decades, reputation effect
            high coef, sig for assorted art
                diversity -> better chance of finding substitutes
        time effects:
            strong for contemp art, assorted art
            weak for impress
            myopic buyers -> msall coefs
        effect of Q1 on price:
            better for impressionist & assorted art
            worse for contemporary art
        similar rsq as replication work, high f statistics

    Q2
        anchoring effects:
            similar as Q1 - sig for impress and assorted, not sig for contemp
            smaller coefs overall
            ### should talk about why get similar effects

        effect of Q2:
            impress art: less significant
            becomes sig for contemporary art
            becomes stronger for Q1
