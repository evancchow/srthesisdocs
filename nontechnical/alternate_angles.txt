Note: your work is more useful than Beggs & Graddy since applicable to substitute
goods and not just resale (of which there are far fewer examples).

------------------

Maybe focus on accuracy of presale estimates?

seller-side anchoring
    + estimating reserve prices
    depends if your data is good enough

sales of similar artistic items.

anchoring between related items (e.g. similar materials, same artists / artistic period)
    maybe same medium?
    masterpiece effect - same lot for art pieces (downside: little supporting evidence for masterpiece effect)

test "folk wisdom" - anecdotal beliefs in the art industry (e.g. "burning", see Beggs & Graddy 2008)

other behaviorial phenomena: loss aversion, overconfidence effect, overreaction ...

------------------

got the datasets originally used for anchoring effects papers -> plan to run regression very soon
anchoring effects for my dataset - 
    my dataset = much more recent (2006 - 2015)
    much smaller gap between auctions -> better for studying anchoring effects (anchoring effects are much stronger with smaller time period, Graddy et al. 2014) 
    anchoring between related items (substitute goods) - focus primarily on same medium (e.g. oil on canvas)
something with cross-elasticity of demand?
asymmetric anchoring, e.g. more for positive than negative. (see working paper by beggs & graddy, 2005)
