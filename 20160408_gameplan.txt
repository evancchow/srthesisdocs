note: don't revise for writing style today.
- Finish introduction with stephen morris suggestions
- revise sections so don't repeat what is in introduction / is complementary to introduction (make this your main focus, don't even worry about cutting stuff down yet)
- review results - make sure not contradictory to other parts of paper.
    also, make sure that it's clear which things show anchoring effects and which don't. (maybe just 1-2 sentences etc.)

- ALTERNATE QUICKLY BETWEEN REVISION/PRINTING AND WRITING. Don't be a perfectionist when it comes to revision, though do try to identify important things. More important to 
go back, write some more, then print out again and revise.
