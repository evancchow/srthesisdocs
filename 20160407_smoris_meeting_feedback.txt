Document - expert interviews.
    say who talked with
    (maybe when discuss datasets)
    name them in paper?

findings in introduction.
intro - good to know 2 paragraphs in depth - what you do in your thesis + findings.
(do have to do extract results)
what try to do and what succeed in doing
- reader and second grader: need to know what you consider important.

more discussion on how to get data.
sentence or 2 regarding: how get Impress / Contemp / data.
    format of data etc.


highlight fact: data from multiple sources.
do mention in intro - collected data with technology, got other data from emailing prof, etc.

"to our knowledge, no work has examined so far" [substitutes]. right now you say "nearly" - is there work you haven't acknowledged?
so search sub literature if you have time to check.

sub measures -> discuss earlier: the collinear problem you were having.
highlight fact it is ont trivial to find measures that work
(?? independent of hedonic preds in the regression model ??)

measure #1: make cleaner. say how you filter for substitutes (same artist, medium etc.)

say measure #1 is distinct from average sub, describe how it covers variance.
sensitivity to group of subs
sensitivity to log specification

robustness checks - substitution

useful to describe other things you considered.

flagging as attract feature: use very different measures of substitution, get similar findings.

impressionist data: say how it's old, unlabelled units / dimensions, units .,.. how get, contacted

dimension - make sure you know when this refers to "literal" dimension (area of painting)

talk about / clarify: nyc vs. london excchange rate:

intro: do mention black box issue. Mention Beggs & Graddy - that they treat this as black box.

*************************************************
* email 2 paragraphs intro to dr. morris
*
*************************************************

issue: can we interpret this as anchoring?
discussion of literature: make it very clear which papers interpret as psychological anchoring and which do not.

Hong et al. 2015 - maybe they make psychological interpretation?
Then say why we chose the black box approach.

Results - when describe findings, very high level description. Could give more

logs -> percent change - talk about this in your methodology

give description of variables. (beg specific)
formatting: report regreassion results as in beggs & graddy or other theses, e.g. t-statistic under estimate, etc.

may be interesting to look @ other regressino variables that are not the main focus (if time maybe).

if time: discuss very briefly - why I don't theorize. (may not be interesting from theoretic point of view ...)
