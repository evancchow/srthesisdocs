Looking briefly at the list: 

miro and dali would be a good match up (both do paintings and prints in a similar Surrealist milieu and often attract the same kind of client and price points) 

Chagall and picasso might be interesting....both have enjoyed incredible commercial success, though Chagall's prices have been faltering in recent years (both also produced both prints and paintings which would give you more sales data) 

munch and toulouse lautrec: both did prints and paintings around the same time but in different styles, but have enjoyed similar levels of economic and critical success (maybe compare one of chagall's biblical themes to a lautrec dancer) 

hockney and lichtenstein: work in different styles but are both pop artists and by nature popular. you could compare two iconic works: a hockey pool and a lichtenstein comic woman and see how they compare. 

I would avoid rembrandt or durer or other old masters because the price of their works is often determined by their relative rarity at the time or their condition of wear, which can be impossible to tell based on auction results

*I have not listed any Chinese artists, mostly because I haven't studied that market as much 

hope that helps! let me know if you have questions!
