prints - usually 100 or 150 batches
around 3-4 common methodologies
etching; lithographs; engravings; osset lithographs
1/100 = #1 out of 100 copies

behaviorial bias
change in fundamental value
efficient markets - would be same 
but prints can change actually in quality
    fade over time: ink & paper, e.g. under uniplex glass could scratch
    could get torn
    prints - can change over time. no prints are really the same.
    repeat sales - go through
    edition #s
standardize for everything that could impact value (condition)
prints - can't assume are all the same. can change condition.
must standardize via fundamental value.
edition - whole batch of 100, 250 ...
previous owners, auction houses etc.
cross

similarity - auction prices
how to frame question?
can we assume the market is efficient?
clarify assumptions
look at buyer point of view, think about what they want. -> shape how you view substitute goods.

important factors:
- size
can you put it on a wall? e.g. if you want to show off an art piece. CAVEAT: this is actually a bad predictor of price.
(bigger does not always mean more expensive)
drivers of similarity - different @ different price points.
maybe size difference - not as important if art is an investment, for example, rather than piece on a wall.
middle market - more of decoration.
avoid own bias when thinking about similarity.
- artist - proxy for style
- medium
    pencil, ink = drawing
    (summarize into categories: paintings, sculpture, drawing, prints)
    picasso - print
very complex - even artist + date is problematic, artists go through different periods of styles -> approximate periods of artist by style.
- date of auction
    date, medium, size
impressionist to modern - subcategories
    surrealist
    post impressionist
    date could be proxy for subcategory of art.
    artists do impact each other.

ask an art history major @ school to help out.

study from 80's / 90's - do auction estimates bias price?
found yes - does bias up. look @ high estimate

CREDIT IN THESIS - YES
