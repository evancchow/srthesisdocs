Select clips from interview. transcribe fully later, right now write down insights.

art history class - never learn about price tags for art pieces

gauging similarity:
auciton business is really unique in that it's still run the same way as it has been since the 1880s.
from my perspective - very little research (economic) on the part of auction houses to figure out corollaries.
hasn't been a need - people continue to buy, sure auction houses are interested
if something sells at higher price - probably indicates higher demand for art in general.
exceptions: e.g. that one modiliani that sold for $169M, anomaly.
two bidders pitted against each other. (more for show)

what might you attribute to high prices?
- red -> higher prices, will set estimates higher. attractive to people - psychology, people are hanging in homes, like red. 
- nude figure sells for more than landscape. what drives higher interest - story or narrative in work. if more boring artwork, more about collector
or how is collector's achievement. however, if can tell story about figure, narrative or human figure, sell for more.
- if someone famous owned the art piece previously. myopic - what matters is who previously owned a piece rather than its entire piece.
e.g. andy warhol's collection sold for very high but pieces have gone back to regular price since. this phenomenon especially for pieces (e.g. furniture) that you wouldn't display in home,
more for value from owner or artist.

what do you look for to appraise value of artowrk?
- authenticity: 
done in first set, markings, registered by artists as prints instead of thrown away, artist includes something in their work or doesn't -> determines value (e.g.
whether signed or not), if andy warhol signed -> could be worth twice as much even though looks same to layman. 
- things that deviate from what we usually think about artist's style (e.g. an unusual picasso, etc.). maybe not interesting to commercial art market though.
- date of when was made - artists go through different stylistic periods.

similarity between goods
- start with name of artist -> could be different artists, but have similar art style, similar weight or gravity in art market. or maybe same artist.
- choose subject matter that is incredibly similar. for example still life - artists paint that throughout history - maybe pick two that look similar.
- stay in modern & contemporary, if get into old masters -> prices are much more expensive, market is old and less thick.
