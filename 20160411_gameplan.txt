bibliography - go through, compile all references and format into bibliography (without removing footnotes). Then go through and clean up / remove footnotes so references are included.
some footnotes should be like: 1 See X (1082), Y (2014), and Z (3014) for further discussion.
-> PUT ALL SECTIONS TOGETHER, WITH FINAL FIGURES + TABLES -> should be good enough estimate for page count. SEND YOUR STUFF TO PEQUOD BY 3 PM so you can get this on Tuesday

if have time, go back and clean up results
