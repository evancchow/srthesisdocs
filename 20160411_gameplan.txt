-> REVISE REST OF PAPER (LAST WERE AT METHODOLOGY), WITH JESSICA'S COMMENTS
-> REVISE ONE MORE TIME WITH JAMAL'S COMMENTS
-> PRINT OUT AND READ, MAKE FINAL EDITS
bibliography - go through, compile all references and format into bibliography (without removing footnotes). Then go through and clean up / remove footnotes so references are included.
some footnotes should be like: 1 See X (1082), Y (2014), and Z (3014) for further discussion.
-> PUT ALL SECTIONS TOGETHER, WITH FINAL FIGURES + TABLES -> should be good enough estimate for page count. SEND YOUR STUFF TO PEQUOD BY 3 PM so you can get this on Tuesday
-> then write up formatting nice.
if have time, go back and clean up results


do bibliography / citations (do clean up interview citations too: move names to footnotes.)

clean figures and tables
then polish references

add page numbers

-----------------------------------------------------

STILL LEFT TO DO:

clean up figures and tables + references
(fix tables first, then go back and check the references in the paper to those tables)

polish abstract (w/jamal's edits)

make sure is consistent:
    references to past literature (see jamal's note)
    we vs. i (should do 'we' throughout)

polish results
